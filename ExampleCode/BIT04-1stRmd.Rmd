## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

---
params: 
  filename: "iris.csv"
---
```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

## Structure of the iris dataset

With the str() function you get a nice overview of the structure of the data 
in the data frame.

```{r}
str(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(6,6,4,4))
hist(iris$Sepal.Length, main = "Histogram of sepal length")
hist(iris$Sepal.Width, main = "Histogram of sepal width")
hist(iris$Petal.Length, main = "Histogram of petal length")
hist(iris$Petal.Width, main = "Histogram of petal width")
# Now repeat in a loop, set x-axis labels and ylim from 0 to 35
figures <- colnames(iris[,1:4]) # exclude column 5 (Species)
for(figure in figures) {
  hist(iris[,figure], main = paste0("Histogram of ",figure),
       xlab = figure, ylim = c(0,40))
}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
